To create the file we have to detect the amount of the time the elements are being repeated.


class solution:
  def firstUniqChar(self,s):
    ## First of all we will make a track record of how many number of elements are present. Then if it will show increment we will add 1 to it and if 
    value gets incremented we will return the value.##
    ##First we will store it in the array.
    
        counter = Counter(s)
      
    
    ##now check the frequency of the character from left to right and return 1 if it shows incrementation.##
     for i, c in enumerate(s):
     enumerate allows us to iterate through the sequence and it also allows to keep the track of index and elements.
            if counter[c] == 1:
                return i
            
        return -1
